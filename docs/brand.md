# Monsoon Brand Guidelines

## Introduction

### What is Monsoon?

Monsoon is an esports team centered around the idea that competitive gaming can both be fun and rewarding. We value a welcoming environment that breeds a sense of community while also competing at a high level. Our players are the most important part of our team and we strive to provide them with the best possible experience by supporting and cultivating their growth.

### Mission

Our mission is to find, develop, and reward the best players in the world by providing them with the best possible environment to succeed.

### Vision

We envision a world where professional competitive gaming is accessible to everyone and where players are rewarded for their hard work and dedication.

## Colours

### Requirements

Our colour palette should be accessible above all else, and should be able to be used in a variety of contexts. The colours should be accessible to people with colour blindness. This means our primary colour pairings should have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1. We should also be able to use our colours in a variety of ways, such as in gradients, shadows, and outlines.
