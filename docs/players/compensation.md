# Player Compensation

## Prerequisites for Compensation

In order to be eligible for compensation, a player must meet the following criteria:

- Have been a member of the team for at least 30 days

## Compensation Items

The following is a list of all the ways that players can be compensated for their time and effort in the team.

- **Contenders Payments:** While the team is considered at a contenders-level ability, each player can file a claim for up to 10 hours a week of paid practice at a rate of $10 (USD) per hour.
- **Competition Winnings:** Any and all winnings from competitions that the team are involved in are split evenly between all members. Management does not take a cut of these winnings.
  - **Complete Absence:** If a player is not present for a competition, they will not receive any of the winnings from that competition.
  - **Ringers:** If a player is a ringer for a competition, they will receive the same cut of the winnings as the other players in the team. See [the Ringers document](../ringers.md#compensation) for more information.
- **[Discord Nitro](https://discord.com/nitro):** Each player receives a single month of the $9.99 Discord Nitro as a gift per month sent to their DMs on request.
