### Q: How are Contenders teams compensated? Is it a salary or a prize pool? How does it work?

**A:** Compensation is very rare, only from prize pools or advertisements. The prize pool is usually split between the players and the team, but it is not a salary. $200 a month is the average salary for a player in a "good" team.

### Q: How many hours were players expected to practice and play per week?

**A:** It depends on the team, but usually around 30 hours a week.

### Q: What is the connection between Contenders and Overwatch League? Is there a direct path to the Overwatch League from Contenders?

**A:** Academy teams are the only connection between Contenders and Overwatch League.

### Q: Does Blizzard provide any support for Contenders teams? If so, what kind of support?

**A:** Contenders games are admined and organized by Blizzard, but they don't provide any support for the teams directly.

### Q: How do you think teams can effectively scout and recruit new players to join their roster?

**A:** Look at the Overwatch Open Division, it's a good place to find new players.

### Q: What are the biggest mistakes that new teams make, and how can they avoid them?

**A:** Being transparent with the players is the first thing management should do. The players need to know what is going on with the team, and they need to be able to trust the management.

Players play, coaches coach, managers manage. All roles in the roster are important, but all roles need to be filled by the right people and must ultimately support the players first.

### Q: What do you think sets the top esports teams apart from the rest, and what can other teams learn from them?

**A:** The standards must be set high for the players' comfort and support. The scene right now is very results-focused, it's important to remember that the players are people too.

Inter-organiational relationships are important, and the teams should be able to work together to improve the scene as a whole. Collaboration is the key to building a better environment for all.
